# Tutorials
## How to run?
First of all you need Haskell Tool Stack installed on your computer. You can find the installation instructions at docs.haskellstack.org<br><br>
In the site it doesn't get mentioned apparently but if you're using MacOS and brew package manager you can easily install it with `brew install haskell-stack`.<br><br>
After that run these two commands. <br>
`
~$ stack build
`
<br><br>
first, and then:
<br>
`
~$ stack ghci
`
<br><br>
To run Tutorial1 and Tutorial2 functions, input commands with function names along with their correct parameters (inputs).
There is only two tutorials available currently.
